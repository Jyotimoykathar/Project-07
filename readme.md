## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox Css

### Time required

Nearly three day required to get the desired position of the image.

### What I learned

This is the css design code snippet of the attribute selections that i learned through this project.

```css
[alt="logo"] {
  width: 12rem;
}
[alt="actions"] {
  display: none;
}
[name="menu-outline"] {
  display: block;
  font-size: 5rem;
  cursor: pointer;
}
.nav-items {
  display: none;
}
[alt="circles"] {
  width: 80%;
}
```

### Continued development

I still have a lot to learn about image positioning and with media breakpoints.

### Useful resources
